She teaches yoga and Ayurveda in the New York City as well as 200 hr yoga teacher trainings and traveling retreats around the world with her sister, husband, father and brother bud! She loves animals and has been a lifelong vegetarian. Syama places a strong emphasis on tapping into the rhythm of breath as it guides movement.

					<h6>Dhyana Masla</h6>
					<p>Raised on the bath of Bhakti Yoga, Dhyana has been visiting India since her childhood. Her father opened the Ayurveda Health Retreat when she was 12 years old, and at the age of 15 she taught her first yoga class and was trained in the science of Ayurvedic body treatments. After seeing patient after patient experiencing deep transformation through the simple lifestyle practices of Yoga and Ayurveda, her faith in the sciences deepened and she wanted to learn more. She received her undergraduate degree in Yoga & Psychology at Naropa University and in 2011, along with her sister and father, founded YogaVeda; the Yoga Alliance certified school for uniting the philosophy, lifestyle, and sciences of Bhakti Yoga & Ayurveda. </p><p>She is an Ayurvedic Wellness Counselor and a dedicated student of Radhanath Swami on the path of Bhakti Yoga, deeply inspired to share the life transforming practices and principles of the path of devotion. Founding director of Stanton Street Yoga in New York City, and co-director of Yoga & Ayurveda trainings at the Bhakti Center, she leads teacher trainings, retreats, workshops and pilgrimages internationally. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dhyana.masla/?hl=en" target="_blank">@dhyana.masla</a> <a href="https://www.thesisterscience.com" target="_blank">www.thesisterscience.com</a></p>

					<h6>Ira Ruiz</h6>
					<p>Born and raised in the west side of Puerto Rico, Ira is a dance-movement artist and yogini with a love for the rhythm in nature, dance-movement as creative expression, and deep sincere spiritual connections. She has dedicated most of her life to the study of dance-movement, focusing on the multiple ways one is able to use, and create with the body. After obtaining her Psychology degree, Ira felt inspired to cultivate different means for self-exploration and inner communication, which brought her face to face with yoga.</p><p>
After completing 300hrs within the path of Bhakti Yoga at The Bhakti Center NYC, she delved deep into her own study and path towards self-awareness and self-realization in the hopes of being an inspiration for others to connect to the innermost part of the Self. She sees Yoga as a way to encourage and empower practitioners to rise above their current state of awareness, and create connection with the inner and outer environment.</p><p>

Focusing on alignment and core strengthening, Ira guides a creative, yet challenging Vinyasa, exploring the connection between breath and consciousness, as well as the powerful and transformative experience that it is to witness your authentic Self. She now leads, workshops, retreats and teacher trainings in New York City & Puerto Rico.</p>

					<h6>Ann-Mary Kay</h6>
					<p>Ann-Mary Kay is an RYT800 yoga teacher; trained in Vinyasa, Restorative Yoga and Meditation, as well as a Reiki Master and Somatic Voicework Teacher. Born and raised in Denmark, her adventurous heart called her to travel through South America for 8 months in 1999. It was on this journey that she found the beautiful ancient practice of yoga. Inspired to live in a place where all cultures meet and blend, she moved to NYC in 2000 to pursue Music and Acting, while continuing to deepen her Yoga practice. Ann-Mary completed her first 200 hour teacher training at Laughing Lotus Yoga Center in 2011, and has been teaching and broadening her studies ever since, both in NYC, CO, MA and in India. Over the years she has come to fully embrace herself as a healer. Her true calling is holding sacred space for others, as they too, dive deep into their own souls to find the truth, freedom, connection, grounding and happiness, that we are all longing for. Nothing makes her happier than seeing the light shine bright in others, as they discover the vast depths and power of who they are.</p>

					<h6>Alexandra Moga</h6>
					<p>I began practicing meditation and breathing techniques at the age of 7 under the guidance of my aunt. In 2001, I took my first yoga class and found the practice perfectly served my natural penchant for movement and innate dedication to seeking truth through spirituality. After 5 years living and studying abroad in Paris, I returned to my birthplace of New York and completed the New York Yoga Society's teacher training at Ananda Ashram under the tutelage of Ashtanga master David Hollander.</p><p> After working with children in a Brooklyn charter school, I was drawn to Bent on Learning's Kids' Yoga training to better understand the subtleties of sharing yoga with youth. Soon, India called and I was able to dedicated 6 months to immersing myself in the teachings of the Bhakti tradition, adding a new facet of depth and understanding to my practice and teaching. Overall, I seek to understand and serve the needs of the students before me in each class, which varies considerably at times. </p><p>These days, my classes are influenced by Ashtanga's physicality and Bhakti's wisdom. I am ever-grateful to the many teachers who have guided and inspired me with their humor, compassion, servitude, intelligence, devotion and kindness: Raghunath Cappo, Dhanurdhara Swami, His Holiness Radhanath Swami, and His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. I look forward to sharing this rich practice with you!</p>

					<h6>Tal Saporta</h6>
					<p>Tal Saporta was born in Tel-Aviv, Israel where she spent her childhood surfing the waves of the Mediterranean sea. At the age of 17 she started to compete in local surfing events and soon became the women's surfing champion of Israel for three years in a row. In the last decade Tal traveled the world to compete, looking for the best waves. Early during her surfing carrier Tal's surfing coach introduced her to the yoga world. She began practicing daily and was amazed from the impact on her physical and mental state. </p><p>Tal followed the path of yoga and became a full time instructor. She considers each practice as an opportunity for new insights and feelings. Tal's journey into yoga allowed her to find balance that goes far beyond surfing waves. She enjoys practicing and teaching inversions, and finds joy in being upside-down. She is excited to be a teacher in Stanton Street Yoga and looking forward to practicing together.</p>

					<h6>Petya Georgiev</h6>
					<p>Petya first discovered yoga in a workshop in college. At this time she didn't know anything about the science or philosophy of the practice but was attracted to the loving and healing energy her teacher brought to the small class. Not long after, she realized how much wisdom lies even further than the asana practice, and decided to go even deeper into its study. </p><p>Petya began to take more eastern philosophy courses in school, started reading sacred texts, experimented with different practices, and eventually embarked upon an internship, where she spent time living in a Zen monastery in the mountains. There, she continued to train through the Rinzai Zen lineage for numerous silent retreats and workshops in a more hard and strict discipline setting. However, as with many aspects of life, there is no "one-size-fits-all" when it comes to a devoted practice; Petya returned to her feelings and found that the Bhakti path of yoga was aligning more with her inner emotional and heart centered side. Now, embedded in Bhakti, Petya continues to go deep through chanting, meditating, and using yoga to move in creative, nurturing, and loving ways.</p>

					<h6>Lauren Baptiste</h6>
					<p>On Lauren's first journey through India in 2012, kundalini meditation inspired her to enhance her spiritual life. Upon arrival back in the US, she gravitated towards yoga and eastern homeopathy and found Stanton Street Yoga.</p><p>
In 2017, Lauren completed her 200 RYT from YogaVeda, empowered to share this gift of yoga with the community. Although Lauren's interest for yoga began in 2012, her love for health and wellness stemmed from an early age. She is also a women's health coach, running coach, Reiki practitioner and health advisor. Outside of the wellness world, Lauren is a financial consultant and CPA. Despite the stress and rigidness from the corporate world, yoga continues to pave the way to a path of love, service and devotion (bhakti).</p><p>

Lauren brings creativity, introspection and perspective into each yoga class. Her style integrates power and allows for vulnerability, creating a space for all to thrive.
